And the angel came in unto her, and said: "Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women". And when she saw Him, she was troubled at His saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.And the angel said unto her:" Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest"... And Mary said:" Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word". And the angel departed from her. <i>(Luk 1,26-38)</i>

<p class='ttextx i'>Oh Mary with Your "yes" You have opened heaven's ways, You have achieved the will of the Father. You will be blessed for ever: Your intercession is heard in Heaven, because You have accepted God's plan. Let us pray that we can say "yes" to the Father in every instance He ask it of us. Mary help us to be humble and obedient to God's will.

And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon Him. ...When the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom of the law, Then took he Him up in His arms, and blessed God, and said: "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation... A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." And Joseph and His mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of Him. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother: "Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."<i>(Luk 2,22-35)</i>
<p class='ttextx i'>We need to pay attention to the voice of God, to discern His call and accept the mission He gave us. After the Simeon prophecy, Mary takes into Her Heart the wound of sorrow, but in the silence She accepts the will of Her Father.

And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. And when they saw Him, they were amazed: and His mother said unto Him: "Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing". And he said unto them: "How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but His mother kept all these sayings in her heart. <i>(Luk 2,41-51)</i>
