			<p class="ttextix"> An indulgence is the remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven, a remission, which one of the faithful, properly disposed and under certain definite conditions, can acquire through the Church, which authoritatively dispenses, applying the treasure of the satisfactions of Christ and the Saints.<br><br>
An indulgence is either <b>PLENARY</b> or <b>PARTIAL</b>, depending upon whether it frees one from the whole or from a part of the temporal punishment due to sin. <br><br>
This means that one of the faithful who, with at least a contrite heart, performs a work enriched with a partial indulgence, is granted by the power of the Church that same amount of remission of temporal punishment as he has already obtained by the work itself. In other words, the remission is doubled, and that as often as the work prescribed is performed.  A plenary indulgence means a full remission of temporal punishment, provided that several other conditions apply, in addition  to the work performed or prayer said.<br><br>
A <b>plenary indulgence</b> is granted, if the Rosary is recited in a church or public oratory or in a family group, a religious Community or pious Association; a <b>partial indulgence</b> is granted in other circumstances. </p>
<ul class="ttextix" style="text-indent: 0px;">
	<li>"Now the Rosary is a certain formula of prayer, which is made up of fifteen decades of "Hail Marys" with an "Our Father" before each decade, and in which the recitation of each decade is accompanied by pious meditation on a particular mystery of our Redemption." (Roman Breviary) The name "Rosary," however, is commonly used in reference to only a third part of the fifteen decades.
	</li><br>
	<li>The gaining of the plenary indulgence is regulated by the following norms:
	</li>
	<ol>
	<li>The recitation of a third part only of the Rosary suffices; but the five decades must be recited continuously.</li>
<li> The vocal recitation must be accompanied by pious meditation on the mysteries.</li>
<li>3) In public recitation the mysteries must be announced in the manner customary in the place; for private recitation, however, it suffices if the vocal recitation is accompanied by meditation on the mysteries. </li>

			<font size="2"><i>an excerpt</i></font><br><br>
			<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
<p class="ttextx">
The Rosary of the Virgin Mary, which gradually took form in the second millennium under the guidance of the Spirit of God, is a prayer loved by countless Saints and encouraged by the Magisterium. Simple yet profound, it still remains, at the dawn of this third millennium, a prayer of great significance, destined to bring forth a harvest of holiness. It blends easily into the spiritual journey of the Christian life, which, after two thousand years, has lost none of the freshness of its beginnings and feels drawn by the Spirit of God to "set out into the deep" (duc in altum!) in order once more to proclaim, and even cry out, before the world that Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour, "the way, and the truth and the life" (Jn 14:6), "the goal of human history and the point on which the desires of history and civilization turn".
<br><br>
The Rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium. It is an echo of the prayer of Mary, her perennial Magnificat for the work of the redemptive Incarnation which began in her virginal womb. With the Rosary, the Christian people sits at the school of Mary and is led to contemplate the beauty on the face of Christ and to experience the depths of his love. Through the Rosary the faithful receive abundant grace, as though from the very hands of the Mother of the Redeemer.
